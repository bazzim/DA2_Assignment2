# DA2_Assignment2

This repository contains folders for assignment for Data Analysis 2 and Coding 1. The main aim of this project is to uncover pattern of association between registered COVID-19 cases and registered number of death due to COVID-19 on a given day.


### Data Folder
Contains the COVID-19 case reports on 17 September 2020, which includes daily confirmed cases, daily death cases, daily recovered cases, and daily active cases from 182 countries and territories.
Daily confirmed cases include confirmed and probable (where reported). Daily death cases include confirmed and probable (where reported). Daily recovered cases are estimates based on local media, reports, and state and local reporting when available, and therefore maybe substantially lower than the true number. Daily active cases are calculated as the total daily confirmed cases minus daily death cases and daily recovered cases.

This dataset is taken from:
